**Skyflow-cli** is a command line interface that makes projects setup easier for developers, even for development and production environments.

It's an **aggregation of developer tools** that are put together in order to simplify developers' life. 

It will help you to **start new projects** on several technologies like React, giving you **boilerplates** to start your development without losing your time in webpack configurations or environment setup. 

We also provide you some **tools based on Docker** for all your environments with preconfigured packages, docker-compose management and commands to run and stop your containers. You will no longer search for docker-compose templates on the internet, you will directly add the technologies you need in one command, answer configuration questions and start working on your projects. 

We also provide **frontend frameworks** for SASS development and a **Javascript library** based on a developer friendly syntax. 

**It's time to create, wasting time on setup will no longer be a problem with skyflow.** ðŸš€

You can see the the detailed [documentation](https://skyflow.io/doc) for additional details and full modules description.

We also provide step by step [tutorials](https://skyflow.io/doc#skyflow-tutorials) fo specific use cases like :
